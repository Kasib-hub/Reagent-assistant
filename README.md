# Reagent-assistant

# Summary
The reagent assistant is my ongoing project that I've been working on during my web development learning journey. It has started and stopped several times as learn something, attempt to implement, fail, and then try to plan it out again.

# About
The reagent assistant is projected to be a tool for use in making dilutions at work. The qualification of blood products often requires diluting reagents or anti-sera in order. I find that for my coworkers and I, making the source dilution and creatiing serial dilutions from that source. This means that I must be able to create two-fold dilutions.
