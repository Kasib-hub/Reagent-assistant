# About
The reagent assistant is projected to be a tool for use in making dilutions at work. The qualification of blood products often requires diluting reagents or anti-sera in order. I find that for my coworkers and I, making the source dilution and creatiing serial dilutions from that source. This means that I must be able to create two-fold dilutions.
